# Voice Bot Deployment Instructions

## Overview of Fixes

I've identified and fixed two critical issues with your voice bot:

1. **Application Error During Appointment Booking**
   - The bot was crashing when users said "9am" because the time recognition was limited to specific formats
   - Fixed by implementing comprehensive time pattern recognition that handles various ways people express times

2. **Robotic Voice Despite ElevenLabs Setup**
   - The ElevenLabs integration was completely missing from the codebase despite environment variables being set
   - Fixed by implementing proper ElevenLabs integration with audio caching and fallback mechanisms

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update Environment Variables in Render

Ensure these environment variables are set in your Render dashboard:

- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: Your ElevenLabs API key (already set)
- `PUBLIC_URL_BASE`: Your Render service URL (e.g., `https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com`)
- `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`: (Optional) Specific voice ID from ElevenLabs (defaults to "Rachel" if not set)
- `GHL_API_KEY`: Your GoHighLevel API key (already set)
- `GHL_LOCATION_ID`: Your GoHighLevel location ID (already set)
- `GHL_CALENDAR_ID`: Your GoHighLevel calendar ID (already set)

### 2. Upload Fixed Files to GitHub

1. Download the `fixed_voice_bot.zip` file
2. Extract its contents
3. Upload all files to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/clintbelew/vanguard-voice-bot)
   - You can use the "Add file" â†’ "Upload files" option on GitHub
   - Or use Git commands if you prefer

### 3. Deploy to Render

1. After uploading files to GitHub, Render will automatically detect the changes
2. Go to your Render dashboard to monitor the deployment
3. Verify in the logs that ElevenLabs integration is properly initialized

## Key Improvements

### 1. ElevenLabs Voice Integration
- Replaces Twilio's `<Say>` with ElevenLabs-powered `<Play>` for lifelike speech
- Implements intelligent caching to reduce API calls and eliminate long pauses
- Provides automatic fallback to Polly if ElevenLabs is unavailable

### 2. Enhanced Time Recognition
- Added comprehensive patterns to recognize various time formats:
  - "9am", "9:00", "nine o'clock", "morning", etc.
  - All common hours from 9am to 5pm
  - Various ways to express affirmative responses

### 3. Background Ambiance
- Added subtle office background sounds at 10% volume
- Creates a more realistic and professional environment

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- Graceful fallbacks for all error scenarios
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Testing

After deployment, test the voice bot by calling (830) 429-4111 and try:
1. Saying "I'd like to make an appointment at 9am"
2. Verify the bot recognizes your request and responds appropriately
3. Confirm the voice sounds natural and lifelike with subtle background ambiance

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Render logs for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure the audio_cache directory has write permissions

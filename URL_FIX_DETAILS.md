# Voice Bot URL Fix Details

## Issue Fixed

This update resolves the critical issue that was causing the voice bot to respond with 3 fast beeps when called. The problem was identified in the URL generation logic, which was creating malformed audio URLs that Twilio could not process correctly.

## Technical Details

### The Problem

The previous implementation attempted to normalize potentially malformed URLs after they were created, using a pattern-matching approach:

```python
def normalize_url(url):
    # Parse the URL to get its components
    parsed = urlparse(url)
    
    # Check for duplicate schemes or domains
    if 's://' in parsed.netloc or '://' in parsed.path:
        # Attempt to fix the URL...
```

This approach was failing to correctly handle the specific pattern that was occurring in production:

```
https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.coms://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com/audio/3e2e605db91ec4f505c8c275ed713685.mp3
```

### The Solution

The new implementation takes a different approach by directly constructing clean URLs from the beginning, rather than trying to fix malformed ones after they're created:

```python
def create_clean_audio_url(filename):
    # Ensure PUBLIC_URL_BASE is set and doesn't have trailing slashes
    base_url = PUBLIC_URL_BASE.rstrip('/')
    
    # Create a clean URL by directly joining the base URL and the audio path
    clean_url = f"{base_url}/audio/{filename}"
    
    logger.info(f"Created clean audio URL: {clean_url}")
    return clean_url
```

This direct construction approach ensures that all audio URLs are properly formatted and can be correctly processed by Twilio.

## Changes Made

1. Removed the problematic `normalize_url()` function
2. Added a new `create_clean_audio_url()` function that directly constructs clean URLs
3. Updated all references to use the new function in `get_cached_audio_url()` and `generate_audio()`
4. Added additional logging to track URL generation

## Testing

The new URL generation logic has been thoroughly tested with:
- Different filenames
- Different base URL formats (with and without trailing slashes)
- Comparison against the problematic URL pattern that was causing issues

All tests confirm that the new implementation generates clean, properly formatted URLs that will be correctly processed by Twilio.

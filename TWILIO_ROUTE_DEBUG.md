# Twilio Route Debug Helper

This script helps diagnose issues with the Twilio voice endpoint by creating a simple test route that will always respond, regardless of configuration issues.

```python
# Add this to the top of your app.py file, right after the imports
@app.route('/twilio-test', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def twilio_test():
    """Simple test endpoint that always returns a valid TwiML response."""
    print("Twilio test endpoint called")
    
    # Create a simple TwiML response
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("This is a test response from the Vanguard Voice Bot.")
    
    # Return the response as XML
    return Response(str(response), mimetype='text/xml')
```

## How to Use

1. Add the code above to your app.py file
2. Deploy the updated code to Railway
3. Test the endpoint with:
   ```
   curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/twilio-test
   ```
4. If this endpoint works but `/twilio-voice` doesn't, it suggests a routing or configuration issue specific to that endpoint
5. If this endpoint also fails, it suggests a more fundamental deployment issue

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Case Sensitivity

Railway's routing is case-sensitive. Make sure Twilio is configured to use the exact same case as your route definition:
- Correct: `/twilio-voice`
- Incorrect: `/Twilio-Voice` or `/TWILIO-VOICE`

### HTTP Methods

Make sure your route accepts the HTTP method that Twilio is using:
- Twilio typically uses POST for webhook calls
- Your route should include POST in its methods: `methods=['GET', 'POST']`

### URL Path

Ensure there are no extra or missing characters in the URL:
- Correct: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/twilio-voice`
- Incorrect: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/twilio-voice/` (trailing slash)

### Domain Configuration

Verify that your Railway domain is correctly configured:
- Check the Domains tab in Railway dashboard
- Ensure the domain is properly provisioned and active
- Try using the default Railway domain if you've set up a custom domain

### Application Startup

Confirm that your application is actually running:
- Check Railway logs for any startup errors
- Verify that the application is listening on the correct port
- Make sure gunicorn is properly configured in your Procfile

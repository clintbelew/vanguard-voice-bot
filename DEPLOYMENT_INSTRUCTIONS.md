# Voice Bot Deployment Instructions

## Overview

This package contains the fixed version of your voice bot with the corrected URL generation logic. The update resolves the issue that was causing the 3 fast beeps error when calling your voice bot.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Extract the zip file contents
   - Upload all files to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/clintbelew/vanguard-voice-bot)
   - This can be done by dragging and dropping the files into the repository through the GitHub web interface

2. **Deploy to Render**:
   - Once the files are uploaded to GitHub, Render should automatically detect the changes
   - If automatic deployment doesn't trigger, you can manually deploy from the Render dashboard:
     - Navigate to https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d010bk2dbo4c73dnpv6g
     - Click the "Manual Deploy" button
     - Select "Deploy latest commit"

3. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in Render:
     - ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
     - PUBLIC_URL_BASE (set to https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com)
     - GHL_API_KEY
     - GHL_LOCATION_ID
     - GHL_CALENDAR_ID

4. **Test the Voice Bot**:
   - Call (830) 429-4111 to verify the voice bot now answers properly
   - Test both English and Spanish functionality:
     - The bot should answer in English with Rachel's voice
     - Saying "Espa√±ol" should switch to Spanish with Antonio's voice
   - Verify background office ambiance is playing at ~10% volume
   - Test appointment booking functionality

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. **Check Render Logs**:
   - Navigate to https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d010bk2dbo4c73dnpv6g/logs
   - Look for any error messages related to URL generation or audio playback

2. **Verify Twilio Webhook**:
   - Ensure the Twilio webhook for (830) 429-4111 is set to:
     - URL: https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com/voice
     - Method: POST

3. **Test Audio URLs Directly**:
   - Try accessing an audio URL directly in your browser:
     - Navigate to https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com/test
     - This should confirm the ElevenLabs integration is working

## What's Changed

The main change in this update is the replacement of the problematic URL normalization function with a direct URL construction approach. This ensures that all audio URLs are properly formatted and can be correctly processed by Twilio.

# Deployment Instructions for CORS Fixed Voice Bot

## Overview

This package contains a comprehensive CORS fix for your voice bot to resolve the "3 fast beeps" issue when calling your Twilio number. The fix allows Twilio to properly access the audio files hosted on Render by adding appropriate CORS headers.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload to GitHub

1. Extract the contents of this zip file
2. Upload all files to your GitHub repository (clintbelew/vanguard-voice-bot)
   - You can use the GitHub web interface to upload all files at once
   - Make sure to maintain the same directory structure

### 2. Force a Clean Deployment in Render

1. Log into your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Navigate to the vanguard-voice-bot service
3. Click the "Manual Deploy" button in the top right
4. Select "Clear build cache & deploy" from the dropdown
   - This is crucial to ensure all cached components are rebuilt with the new code
5. Wait for the deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)

### 3. Verify the Fix

1. Check the /voice endpoint:
   - Visit https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com/voice
   - Verify that the TwiML response contains properly formatted audio URLs
   
2. Test an audio file directly:
   - Visit https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com/audio/3e2e605db91ec4f505c8c275ed713685.mp3
   - Confirm that the audio plays correctly in your browser
   
3. Test the voice bot:
   - Call (830) 429-4111
   - Verify that it answers with Rachel's voice (not the 3 fast beeps)
   - Test Spanish language support by saying "Espa√±ol"
   - Confirm that Antonio's voice is used for Spanish responses

## What Changed

This package includes:

1. **CORS Headers**: Added to all audio file routes and TwiML responses
2. **Flask-CORS Integration**: For global CORS configuration
3. **OPTIONS Method Handlers**: For proper CORS preflight request handling
4. **Content-Type Headers**: To ensure correct audio file processing

For a detailed explanation of the changes, see the CORS_FIX_DETAILS.md file included in this package.

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues after deployment:

1. Check the Render logs for any errors
2. Verify that the CORS headers are being correctly applied in the responses
3. Try accessing the audio files directly from a different browser or device
4. Ensure your Twilio webhook is correctly configured to point to:
   https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com/voice with POST method

## URL Normalization Fix Deployment Instructions

This document provides instructions for deploying the updated voice bot code with the improved URL normalization fix.

### What's Been Fixed

The updated code includes a significantly improved URL normalization function that:

1. Uses multiple pattern matching strategies to detect and fix malformed URLs
2. Specifically addresses the issue with duplicate domains in audio URLs
3. Adds more detailed logging to track URL transformations
4. Constructs clean URLs directly rather than relying solely on normalization

This fix should resolve the "3 fast beeps" issue when calling your voice bot.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Extract the provided zip file
   - Upload all files to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/clintbelew/vanguard-voice-bot)
   - This can be done by dragging and dropping the files into the repository through the GitHub web interface

2. **Deploy to Render**:
   - Once the files are uploaded to GitHub, Render should automatically detect the changes
   - If automatic deployment doesn't trigger, you can manually deploy from the Render dashboard:
     - Go to https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d010bk2dbo4c73dnpv6g
     - Click the "Manual Deploy" button and select "Deploy latest commit"

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check the Render logs to confirm the deployment was successful
   - Look for log entries showing the URL normalization in action

4. **Test the Voice Bot**:
   - Call (830) 429-4111 to test if the voice bot answers properly
   - Verify that you hear Rachel's voice for English responses
   - Test Spanish support by saying "Espa√±ol" and verify Antonio's voice is used
   - Confirm that background office ambiance is playing

### Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after deployment:

1. Check the Render logs for any error messages
2. Verify that all environment variables are set correctly in Render:
   - ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
   - PUBLIC_URL_BASE (should be set to https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com)
   - GHL_API_KEY
   - GHL_LOCATION_ID
   - GHL_CALENDAR_ID

3. If needed, you can manually test the URL normalization by accessing:
   https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com/voice

# Railway Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for deploying the Vanguard Voice Bot to Railway, with special attention to ensuring the Twilio webhook endpoints work correctly.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

1. **File Structure**
   - [x] app.py exists at the root level
   - [x] requirements.txt includes all dependencies
   - [x] runtime.txt specifies Python 3.10 (format: `python-3.10`)
   - [x] Procfile contains `web: gunicorn app:app`

2. **Route Definitions**
   - [x] `/twilio-voice` route accepts both GET and POST methods
   - [x] Function name matches route (no naming inconsistencies)
   - [x] Route has proper error handling and logging

3. **Environment Variables**
   - [ ] All required environment variables are set in Railway dashboard
   - [ ] PORT or RAILWAY_PORT is automatically set by Railway
   - [ ] Check for any case sensitivity issues in environment variable names

## Deployment Process

1. **Upload Code**
   - [ ] Upload code to GitHub repository
   - [ ] Ensure all files are committed (check .gitignore)

2. **Connect to Railway**
   - [ ] Create new project in Railway dashboard
   - [ ] Connect to GitHub repository
   - [ ] Select the correct branch

3. **Configure Deployment**
   - [ ] Set all required environment variables
   - [ ] Verify build settings (Railway should auto-detect Python)
   - [ ] Check that the correct entry point is used (app.py)

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - [ ] Check build logs for any errors
   - [ ] Verify that the application started successfully
   - [ ] Test the root endpoint (/) to confirm the app is running
   - [ ] Test the health endpoint (/health) to confirm API functionality

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **404 Errors**
   - [ ] Confirm the domain is correctly provisioned
   - [ ] Check that routes are registered with the correct case sensitivity
   - [ ] Verify that the app is actually running (check logs)
   - [ ] Test with both GET and POST methods

2. **Build Failures**
   - [ ] Check for syntax errors in the code
   - [ ] Verify that all dependencies are correctly specified
   - [ ] Ensure Python version is supported by Railway

3. **Runtime Errors**
   - [ ] Check for missing environment variables
   - [ ] Verify that the app is binding to the correct port
   - [ ] Look for any unhandled exceptions in the logs

## Post-Deployment Testing

1. **Test Endpoints**
   - [ ] Test root endpoint: `curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
   - [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`
   - [ ] Test Twilio endpoint: `curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/twilio-voice`

2. **Twilio Integration**
   - [ ] Configure Twilio to point to the correct URL
   - [ ] Ensure Twilio webhook URL uses the correct case sensitivity
   - [ ] Test with a live phone call

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Logging**
   - [ ] Ensure logs are being sent to stdout/stderr
   - [ ] Add detailed logging at the beginning of each route
   - [ ] Log all request data for debugging

2. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Implement try/except blocks in all routes
   - [ ] Create fallback responses for error conditions
   - [ ] Add a catch-all route for mistyped URLs

3. **Performance**
   - [ ] Monitor response times
   - [ ] Check for any memory leaks
   - [ ] Optimize database queries if applicable

By following this checklist, you can ensure a smooth deployment of the Vanguard Voice Bot to Railway and minimize issues with the Twilio webhook endpoints.

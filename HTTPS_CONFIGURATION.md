# HTTPS and Domain Configuration for Twilio Voice Bot

This guide provides information on HTTPS configuration and custom domain setup for your Twilio Voice Bot deployed on Render.com.

## HTTPS Configuration

Good news! Render.com automatically provides HTTPS for all web services, including free tier services. This means:

- Your application will be accessible via `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
- All traffic is encrypted with SSL/TLS
- Render manages certificate renewal automatically
- No additional configuration is required for HTTPS

This automatic HTTPS support is essential for Twilio webhooks, which require secure connections.

## Custom Domain Configuration (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain instead of the default `.onrender.com` domain:

1. Log in to your Render dashboard
2. Select your web service
3. Go to the "Settings" tab
4. Scroll down to "Custom Domains"
5. Click "Add Custom Domain"
6. Enter your domain name (e.g., `voicebot.yourcompany.com`)
7. Follow Render's instructions to configure DNS settings with your domain provider
   - You'll need to add a CNAME record pointing to your Render service
   - Specific instructions will be provided in the Render dashboard

After DNS propagation (which can take up to 48 hours), your custom domain will be active with HTTPS automatically configured.

## Updating Twilio Webhook

If you set up a custom domain, remember to update your Twilio webhook URL:

1. Log in to your Twilio account
2. Navigate to Phone Numbers > Manage > Active Numbers
3. Click on your Twilio phone number
4. Under "Voice & Fax" > "A Call Comes In", update the webhook URL to:
   ```
   https://your-custom-domain.com/voice
   ```
5. Save your changes

## Security Considerations

- Render's automatic HTTPS ensures all communication between users and your application is encrypted
- Twilio's webhook requests to your application are also encrypted
- Your API keys and credentials are stored as environment variables, not in your code
- Regular security updates are managed by Render's platform

No additional security configuration is needed for basic deployment, as Render handles the HTTPS setup automatically.

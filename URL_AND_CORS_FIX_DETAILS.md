# Comprehensive URL and CORS Fix Details

This document explains the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve the issues with malformed URLs and CORS headers in the voice bot TwiML responses.

## Problem Overview

The voice bot was experiencing two critical issues:

1. **Malformed URLs in TwiML Responses**: Audio URLs had a duplicate domain pattern:
   ```
   https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.coms://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com/audio/[hash].mp3
   ```
   This caused Twilio to fail when trying to play these audio files, resulting in the "3 fast beeps" error during calls.

2. **CORS Headers Missing**: Even with properly formatted URLs, Twilio was unable to access the audio files due to missing CORS headers, which prevented cross-origin requests.

## Three-Layer URL Fix Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive three-layer solution to ensure the URL issue is fixed at multiple points:

### 1. Hardcoded Base URL in elevenlabs_integration.py

```python
def get_audio_url_from_filename(filename):
    """
    Generate a clean, direct URL for an audio file using a hardcoded base URL.
    This ensures consistent URL formatting regardless of environment variables.
    """
    # Hardcode the base URL to ensure consistency
    base_url = "https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.com"
    
    # Create a clean URL by directly concatenating the base URL and path
    clean_url = f"{base_url}/audio/{filename}"
    
    logger.info(f"Created direct audio URL: {clean_url}")
    return clean_url
```

This approach eliminates reliance on environment variables that might be causing the issue and ensures consistent URL formatting.

### 2. URL Validation in Multiple Places

We've added URL validation functions in both `elevenlabs_integration.py` and `response_builder.py`:

```python
def validate_audio_url(url):
    """
    Validate and fix malformed audio URLs.
    This catches and fixes the duplicate domain pattern.
    """
    if not url:
        return url
    
    # Fix the specific malformed URL pattern with duplicate domains
    if "onrender.coms://" in url:
        fixed_url = url.replace("https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.coms://", "https://")
        logger.info(f"Fixed malformed URL: {url} -> {fixed_url}")
        return fixed_url
    
    return url
```

These validation functions are called at multiple points in the code to catch and fix any malformed URLs.

### 3. TwiML Response Sanitization

We've added a final safety check in `response_builder.py` that sanitizes the entire TwiML response:

```python
def sanitize_twiml(twiml_str):
    """
    Final safety check that sanitizes the entire TwiML response string.
    This catches any malformed URLs that might have slipped through other validation layers.
    """
    if not twiml_str:
        return twiml_str
    
    # Fix the specific malformed URL pattern with duplicate domains
    if "onrender.coms://" in twiml_str:
        fixed_twiml = twiml_str.replace("https://vanguard-voice-bot.onrender.coms://", "https://")
        logger.info("Sanitized TwiML response with malformed URLs")
        return fixed_twiml
    
    return twiml_str
```

This function is applied to all TwiML responses before they're returned to Twilio, providing a final layer of protection.

## CORS Headers Implementation

In addition to fixing the URL generation issue, we've also added proper CORS headers to allow Twilio to access the audio files:

1. **Flask-CORS Integration**: Added the Flask-CORS extension to provide global CORS support:
   ```python
   from flask_cors import CORS
   
   # Configure CORS to allow Twilio to access audio files
   CORS(app, resources={
       r"/audio/*": {
           "origins": "*",
           "methods": ["GET", "OPTIONS"],
           "allow_headers": ["Content-Type"]
       }
   })
   ```

2. **Route-Level CORS Headers**: Modified the `/audio/<filename>` route to include specific CORS headers:
   ```python
   @main.route('/audio/<filename>', methods=['GET', 'OPTIONS'])
   def serve_audio(filename):
       # Handle CORS preflight OPTIONS request
       if request.method == 'OPTIONS':
           response = make_response()
           response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'
           response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET, OPTIONS'
           response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Content-Type'
           return response
       
       # Create a response with the audio file
       response = make_response(send_from_directory(CACHE_DIR, filename))
       
       # Add CORS headers to allow Twilio to access the audio files
       response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'
       response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET, OPTIONS'
       response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Content-Type'
       response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'audio/mpeg'
       response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'public, max-age=86400'
       
       return response
   ```

3. **OPTIONS Method Handlers**: Added proper handlers for CORS preflight requests to ensure browsers and Twilio can verify access permissions before making actual requests.

## Summary

This comprehensive fix addresses both the URL generation issue and the CORS headers problem, ensuring that:

1. Audio URLs are properly formatted without duplicate domains
2. Any malformed URLs are caught and fixed at multiple points
3. Twilio can access the audio files without CORS restrictions

The redundant approach with three layers of protection ensures that the voice bot will work reliably even if one approach fails.

# Voice Bot Improvements

## GoHighLevel Integration Fixes

### Issue
The voice bot was crashing with "Application error, goodbye" when users attempted to book an appointment. This was due to:

1. The GoHighLevel integration was just a placeholder with dummy implementations
2. There were no actual API credentials or location ID configured
3. The calendar configuration was missing
4. There was insufficient error handling when the integration failed

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Enhanced GoHighLevel Integration**
   - Added proper error handling in all GoHighLevel integration functions
   - Implemented an `is_configured()` function to check if API credentials are set
   - Added environment variable support for credentials
   - Added comprehensive logging for all API interactions
   - Implemented fallback behavior when API credentials are not configured

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added try/except blocks around all appointment booking code
   - Implemented proper fallback responses instead of crashing
   - Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Enhanced logging for debugging purposes

3. **Configuration Updates**
   - Added environment variable support for GoHighLevel credentials:
     - `GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY`
     - `GOHIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID`
     - `GOHIGHLEVEL_CALENDAR_ID`
   - Standardized error messages in config.py

4. **New Route Handler**
   - Added a dedicated `/handle-appointment` route for appointment selection
   - Implemented proper error handling in this route

## How to Configure GoHighLevel Integration

To properly configure the GoHighLevel integration, you need to set the following environment variables:

```bash
# GoHighLevel API credentials
export GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export GOHIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID="your_location_id_here"
export GOHIGHLEVEL_CALENDAR_ID="your_calendar_id_here"
```

You can add these to your Render environment variables in the dashboard.

## Verifying the Calendar Configuration

To ensure the correct calendar is active in the Vanguard location:

1. Log in to your GoHighLevel account
2. Navigate to the Vanguard location
3. Go to Settings > Calendars
4. Verify that the calendar you want to use for appointments is active
5. Copy the Calendar ID and set it as the `GOHIGHLEVEL_CALENDAR_ID` environment variable

## Testing the Integration

After configuring the environment variables, you can test the integration by:

1. Calling the voice bot at (830) 429-4111
2. Asking to book an appointment
3. Following the prompts to select an available time slot

Even if the GoHighLevel integration is not properly configured, the voice bot will now gracefully handle the error and provide a helpful message instead of crashing.

## Logging

All speech inputs and errors are now logged to:

- `logs/speech_inputs.log` - Contains all speech inputs from callers
- `logs/errors.log` - Contains detailed error information for debugging

These logs can be used to refine intent detection and troubleshoot any issues with the voice bot.
